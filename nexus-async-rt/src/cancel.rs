//! Cancellation tokens for cooperative task shutdown.
//!
//! Adapted from tokio-util's `CancellationToken` design, built for
//! the nexus-async-rt runtime. `Clone + Send + Sync`. Hierarchical —
//! cancelling a parent cancels all children.
//!
//! Any holder can cancel or await cancellation — no separate sender/
//! receiver roles. This allows any task in a group to trigger shutdown.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! `is_cancelled()` is a single atomic load (lock-free).
//!
//! Awaiter registration uses an **intrusive doubly-linked list** of
//! [`WaiterNode`]s embedded directly in [`Cancelled`] futures. No
//! per-poll heap allocation. The list is protected by a tiny per-token
//! spinlock (~30ns under-lock for the hot poll path; ~1µs to drain
//! N=50 waiters on cancel). The lock is per-`Inner`, never contended
//! across tokens — a process with hundreds of tokens never sees one
//! token's cancel block another.
//!
//! Children of a token use a **lock-free Treiber stack** of
//! `ChildNode`s. Children don't have the "drop while in list" lifetime
//! problem the waiter list had pre-PR3, so the simpler design works.
//!
//! # `Cancelled` is `!Unpin`
//!
//! The intrusive design requires the embedded `WaiterNode`'s address
//! to be stable from first poll until Drop. [`Cancelled`] therefore
//! carries `PhantomPinned` — `.await` auto-pins, but for hot loops
//! that re-poll the same future, **pin once outside the loop**:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::pin::pin;
//!
//! let cancelled = token.cancelled();
//! let mut cancelled = pin!(cancelled);
//! loop {
//!     // poll cancelled.as_mut() — no per-iteration heap traffic
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use nexus_async_rt::CancellationToken;
//!
//! let token = CancellationToken::new();
//!
//! // Any clone can cancel or await:
//! let t = token.clone();
//! spawn_boxed(async move {
//!     match do_work().await {
//!         Ok(()) => t.cancelled().await,  // wait
//!         Err(_) => t.cancel(),           // or trigger
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Hierarchical:
//! let child = token.child();  // cancelled when parent is
//!
//! // Drop guard — cancels on scope exit:
//! let _guard = token.drop_guard();
//! ```
