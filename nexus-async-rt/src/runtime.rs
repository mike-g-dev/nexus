//! Single-threaded async runtime.
//!
//! [`Runtime`] owns an [`Executor`](crate::Executor) for spawned tasks, a
//! boxed root future, and an event-cycle timestamp. The root future is
//! driven to completion by [`block_on`](Runtime::block_on) or
//! [`block_on_busy`](Runtime::block_on_busy).
//!
//! Two spawn strategies:
//! - **`spawn_boxed()`** — Box-allocated. Default. No setup needed.
//! - **`spawn_slab()`** — Slab-allocated. Zero-alloc hot path.
//!   Requires slab configured via [`RuntimeBuilder::slab`].
//!
//! # Thread-local spawn
//!
//! [`spawn`] and [`spawn_slab`] are free functions that push tasks into
//! the current runtime via thread-local pointers set during `block_on`.
//! Calling them outside `block_on` panics.

// Order (top → bottom = first → last drop):
//
//   executor              ← drops first; frees tasks
//   _cross_wake_tls_guard ← drops second; clears CURRENT_RUNTIME_CTX TLS
//   io                    ← UnsafeCell, no Drop concerns
//   timers                ← UnsafeCell, no Drop concerns
//   ctx                   ← WorldCtx, holds raw pointer to user's World
//   event_time            ← Cell<Instant>, trivial
//   shutdown              ← clone of ShutdownHandle, has Arc inside
//   cross_wake            ← Arc<CrossWakeContext>; off-thread holders may
//                           still exist; Arc keeps it alive past Runtime drop

//   _runtime_presence     ← MUST drop AFTER everything (invariant 3)
//   _not_thread_safe      ← PhantomData, no Drop
//
// Invariants:
//
// 1. `_slab_guard` after `executor`
//    Reason: BUG-1 (#167). When `Executor::drop` walks `all_tasks`
//    and encounters slab-allocated survivors, it dispatches their
//    `free_fn` through TLS. The TLS install lives on `_slab_guard`.
//    If `_slab_guard` drops first, slab tasks see the no-slab panic
//    stub.
//    Enforced: `const _:` offset assert below (added pre-PR-1a).
//
// 2. `_cross_wake_tls_guard` after `executor`
//    Reason: PR 1a. When `Executor::drop` walks `all_tasks` and
//    triggers `TaskRef::Drop`, the terminal-drop routing in
//    `dispose_terminal` reads `CURRENT_RUNTIME_CTX` to decide
//    on-thread (defer) vs off-thread (queue). If `_cross_wake_tls_guard`
//    drops first, the on-thread fast path silently misroutes terminal
//    frees to the cross-queue, where nothing drains them — leak,
//    OR for slab tasks, eventual UAF when `_slab_guard` releases
//    the slab backing storage.
//    FAILURE MODE: silent UAF in production for slab tasks.
//    Enforced: `const _:` offset assert below (added in PR 1a).
//
// 3. `_runtime_presence` after everything else
//    Reason: defensive. Some inner Drop impl might attempt to construct
//    another Runtime mid-teardown. With `_runtime_presence` dropping
//    last, the "Runtime alive" flag remains set, and that nested
//    construction panics rather than silently corrupting TLS.
//    Enforced: convention. No const_assert because there are too many
//    fields to assert against; relies on the doc-block + code review.
//
// 4. `cross_wake` outlives off-thread holders implicitly via Arc
//    Reason: cross-thread wakers (channel slots, tokio_compat) hold an
//    Arc<CrossWakeContext>. The Arc keeps the queue alive after Runtime
//    drops. When the LAST off-thread waker drops its Arc, the queue is
//    finally freed. Off-thread `dispose_terminal` calling
//    `try_set_queued + push` on a queue whose Runtime has been dropped
//    is safe: the queue is alive, we push to it, but no consumer
//    drains. The terminal task pointer leaks (memory, not UAF). PR 2
//    §2.3's `ShutdownStats` will surface this as a counter.
//
// Adding new fields:
// - Place trivial fields anywhere; non-trivial fields go to the
//   bottom of the appropriate group.
// - If your field has a Drop with cross-thread implications, document
//   the invariant here AND add an `offset_of` assert next to the
//   existing ones.
// - When in doubt, add to the bottom and document.

// BUG-1 (#167) invariant: `_slab_guard` MUST drop after `executor`.
// Field drop order is declaration order, and offset is a proxy: a
// later-declared field has a higher offset (modulo alignment padding,
// which preserves order). If anyone reorders the fields above, this
// fires at compile time.

/// Returned by [`Runtime::shutdown_quiesce`] when the timeout elapses
/// before the executor reaches a quiesced state.
///
/// The diagnostic fields help identify which producer didn't release
/// its refs:
///
/// - `remaining_cross_queue`: number of cross-thread queue entries
///   still pending at the moment of timeout. Non-zero indicates a
///   producer thread is still pushing wakes faster than quiesce can
///   drain them, OR a final-drain wake landed after the last drain
///   pass — investigate which off-thread producer is still active.
/// - `remaining_outstanding_refs`: number of tasks still in
///   `Executor::all_tasks` at the moment of timeout. Each represents a
///   task with outstanding cross-thread refs (or a held JoinHandle).
/// - `elapsed`: how long quiesce ran before timing out.
///
/// PR 2 §2.4 open-item 5 noted that finer-grained diagnostics
/// ("which task ID had the outstanding ref") could be added if
/// implementation revealed them as cheap to surface. The implementation
/// uses `Executor::task_count()` which doesn't enumerate tasks; adding
/// per-task data here would require new accessors. Out of scope for
