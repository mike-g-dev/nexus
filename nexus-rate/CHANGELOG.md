# Changelog

All notable changes to nexus-rate are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
with the project-specific allowance that a minor bump may carry small,
narrowly-scoped breaking changes when external blast radius is
contained.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.3] — 2026-05-10

Doc + bench infra release. No public API change.

### Changed

- README "performance" tables replaced with measured floors from
  controlled-conditions runs (taskset-pinned P-cores, turbo on,
  best-of-5). Previous claim ("2-4 cycle hot path") was for the
  pure algorithm body; the bench measures realistic per-call cost
  including `Instant + Duration` construction inside the timed
  window. Updated tables: Local variants 11-16cy; Sync variants
  11-29cy; rejection paths included.

### Internal

- `examples/perf_rate.rs` moved to `benches/perf_rate.rs` with
  `harness = false` so `cargo bench -p nexus-rate` discovers it.
- New `BENCHMARKS.md` documenting methodology + baseline tables.

## [2.1.2] and earlier

Earlier history is not documented in this CHANGELOG. See git history
and GitHub release notes for details.
