## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`QuantizedMlp`** — Int8-quantized MLP. Per-layer affine quantization
  (i8 weights, i32 accumulation, f32 activations), symmetric or
  asymmetric, matching PyTorch `torch.ao.quantization`. AVX2 `maddubs`
  integer matmul.
- **`Bnn`** — Binary neural network. ±1 hidden weights via XNOR +
  popcount (`2 * popcount - H`) over packed 64-bit words; f32
  input/output layers. Hidden size must be a multiple of 64.
- **`LinearSsm`** — Linear state-space model (S4/S4D). Diagonal
  recurrence `h_t = A ⊙ h_{t-1} + B @ u_t`, `y_t = C @ h_t + D @ u_t`,
  no transcendental gates.
- **`TinyTcn`** — Temporal convolutional network. Stack of dilated
  causal 1D convolutions (dilation `2^k`), exponential receptive field,
  streaming circular history per layer.
- **safetensors loader** — `from_safetensors` for MLP, QuantizedMlp,
  BNN, LSTM, GRU, Stacked LSTM/GRU, Conv, TCN, SSM. PyTorch tensor-name
  conventions, per-layer counts auto-detected. Behind the default
  `safetensors` feature; PyTorch parity tested via regenerated fixtures.
- **AVX-512 dispatch** — AVX-512F/BW kernels for dot products and RNN
  gates, selected at compile time alongside the AVX2 and scalar tiers.
- **`bias=False` support** — MLP safetensors loader handles PyTorch
  `nn.Linear(bias=False)`. Missing bias tensors are treated as zero bias.
- **BatchNorm fusion** — `nn.BatchNorm1d` layers between linear layers
  are detected by `running_mean` presence and fused into the preceding
  linear layer's weights at load time. `fused_weight = scale * W`,
  `fused_bias = scale * (b - mean) + beta`. Zero runtime cost. Both
  `affine=True` (learned gamma/beta) and `affine=False` (gamma=1,
  beta=0) are supported.
- **LayerNorm support** — `nn.LayerNorm` layers between linear layers
  are detected by 1D `.weight` tensors (without `running_mean`) and
  applied at inference time: `y = gamma * (x - mean) / sqrt(var + eps) + beta`.
  Cannot be fused because statistics depend on each input. New
  `from_parts_with_layer_norm` constructor for manual construction.
  Uses eps=1e-5 (PyTorch default).
- **`StackedLstm`** — Multi-layer LSTM matching PyTorch's
  `nn.LSTM(num_layers=N)`. Each layer's hidden state feeds as input to
  the next; output projection applied only to the final layer.
  `from_safetensors` auto-detects `num_layers` from consecutive
  `weight_ih_l{k}` tensors. `from_parts` accepts per-layer weight
  slices. Same SIMD gate processing as `TinyLstm`.
- **`StackedGru`** — Multi-layer GRU matching PyTorch's
  `nn.GRU(num_layers=N)`. Same stacking model as `StackedLstm`,
  ~75% compute per layer. Auto-detects `num_layers` from safetensors.
- **`TinyLstm`** — Single-layer LSTM for streaming temporal inference.
  Four gates (input, forget, cell candidate, output) with hidden and cell
  state carried between `predict` calls. Fused `(4H, I+H)` gate matrix for
  single-matmul fast path. PyTorch `nn.LSTM` weight layout.
- **`TinyGru`** — Single-layer GRU for streaming temporal inference.
  Three gates (reset, update, candidate), ~75% of LSTM compute. PyTorch
  `nn.GRU` weight layout with reset applied after hidden matmul.
- **`Causal1dConv`** — Streaming causal 1D convolution. Circular buffer,
  configurable activation, no future leakage. `is_primed()` tracks buffer
  fill.
- **AVX2 vectorized gate processing** — Pade [7,6] rational polynomial for
  sigmoid/tanh (~1.2e-7 relative error), 8-wide SIMD gate loop for
  LSTM/GRU. 2-5x faster than scalar glibc transcendentals.
- **`matvec_bias_f32` / `matvec_f32`** — Shared tiled matrix-vector product
  helpers in dot module. 4-at-a-time processing via `dot4_f32`.
- **`Mlp`** — Feedforward neural network inference.
  Runtime-configured layer sizes, row-major weight layout (PyTorch-compatible).
  Activation functions: `Relu`, `LeakyRelu`, `Tanh`, `Sigmoid` (hidden layers only,
  output layer is raw linear). `predict()` for single-output, `predict_into()`
  for multi-output.
- **`Lut`** — Lookup table predictor. Uniform bin spacing,
  Horner indexing, clamped out-of-range features. O(1) prediction.
- **`Activation`** enum — `Relu`, `LeakyRelu(f32)`, `Tanh`, `Sigmoid`,
  `Identity`, `Elu(f32)`, `Gelu`, `Swish`.
- **GBDT API additions** — `predict_into()`, `predict_into_unchecked()`,
  `n_outputs()` for API consistency with MLP and LUT.

### Changed

- **f32-only models** — removed all f64 model and kernel variants
  (`MlpF64`, `LutF64`, and the f64 dot kernels). Models infer in f32;
  GBDT still trains in f64 externally and loads as f32. Breaking for any
  f64-typed usage.
- **Unified prediction API** — every model exposes `predict` /
  `predict_into`; the old `step` / `step_into` names are removed.
  Stateless models (GBDT, MLP, LUT, BNN, QuantizedMlp) take `&self`
  (interior mutability via a pre-allocated scratch buffer); stateful
  models take `&mut self`. New `Model` and `StatelessModel` traits for
  dynamic dispatch over mixed model types.
- **Accessor naming** — `n_inputs` / `n_outputs` / `n_hidden` /
  `n_layers` / `n_features` / `n_filters` replace the earlier
  `input_size` / `output_size` / `num_layers` accessors.
- **Branchless GBDT traversal** — the decision-tree walk uses a single
  cmov per level (`select_unpredictable`) over 8-byte nodes in a
  false-branch-next layout, for deterministic latency (p90/p50 < 1.04x).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **`Gbdt`** — Gradient-boosted decision tree ensemble inference.
  Flat node arrays, depth-first layout, 16-byte nodes. `predict()` with
  NaN routing (LightGBM-compatible), `predict_unchecked()` without NaN checks,
  `predict_n()` for partial ensemble evaluation.
- **LightGBM text format loader** — `Gbdt::from_lightgbm(&[u8])`.
  Parses LightGBM model text files.
  Requires `loader-lightgbm` feature.
